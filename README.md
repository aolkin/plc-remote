PLC Remote
=================================

Software for a remote raspberry pi hardware client for the PLC framework.


Requirements
---------------------------------

This runs on a Raspberry Pi, but requires Python 3.4 and the I2C smbus module.
So far, that means manually compiling and installing each of those, with the
Python 3 smbus workaround easily found on the web. The RPi.GPIO module is
also needed.
